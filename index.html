			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The desert biome is a dry and harsh environment that covers about one-fifth of the Earth's land surface. It is characterized by extreme temperatures, low rainfall, and sparse vegetation. Despite its inhospitable conditions, the desert biome is home to a diverse range of plant and animal species that have adapted to survive in this challenging environment.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="climate">
			<h2>Climate</h2>
			<p>The desert biome is known for its hot and dry climate, with temperatures ranging from 20°C to 50°C during the day and dropping to below freezing at night. Rainfall is rare and unpredictable, with some areas receiving less than 25mm of rain per year. The lack of water and extreme temperatures make the desert biome a challenging environment for most living organisms.</p>

		<section id="plants">
			<h2>Plants</h2>
			<p>Plants in the desert biome have evolved to survive in the harsh conditions of this environment. They have adapted to conserve water, and many have shallow roots that spread out to capture as much moisture as possible. Some common desert plants include cacti, succulents, and shrubs.</p>

		<section id="animals">
			<h2>Animals</h2>
			<p>The desert biome is home to a diverse range of animal species, including reptiles, birds, and mammals. Animals in the desert biome have adapted to survive in the extreme temperatures and lack of water. Some common desert animals include snakes, lizards, coyotes, and camels.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="adaptations">
			<h2>Adaptations</h2>
			<p>Plants and animals in the desert biome have evolved unique adaptations to survive in this harsh environment. Some common adaptations include the ability to store water, the ability to burrow underground to escape the heat, and the ability to regulate body temperature to prevent overheating.</p>
