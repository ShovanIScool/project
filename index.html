			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The desert biome covers about one-fifth of Earth’s surface. This biome has a layer of soil that can either be sandy, gravelly, or stony, depending on the type of desert.

                Plants in deserts have adapted to conserve water. Cacti have enlarged stems to store water, as well as spines to protect these water reserves from thirsty animals. Animals such as the black tailed jackrabbit Lepus californicus are also adapted to life in the desert.
                
                The four main types of desert include hot and dry deserts,coastal deserts, and cold deserts. In hot and dry deserts, also known as arid deserts, the temperatures are warm and dry year round. Some famous arid deserts include the Sahara Desert and the Mojave Desert located in the southwest of the United States. Semi-arid deserts are a bit cooler than hot and dry deserts. The long, dry summers in semi arid deserts are followed by winters with some rain. Semi arid deserts are found in North America, Greenland, Europe, and Asia. Coastal deserts are a bit more humid than other types of deserts. Although heavy fogs blow in from the coast, rainfall is still rare. The Atacama Desert of Chile in South America is an example of a coastal desert. Cold deserts are still dry but have extremely low temperatures in comparison to the other types of deserts. The Antarctic is an example of a cold desert..</p>

			<h2>Climate</h2>
			<p>Due to the availability of little moisture in the air to capture and hold on to the heat from the high temperatures during the day, desert nights are typically cold. A combination of extreme temperature and incredibly low levels of water makes the desert biome a very harsh land mass to live in. Temperatures are so extreme during the day because there is very little moisture in the atmosphere to block out the sun’s rays. This means that the sun’s energy is absorbed on the ground surface. The ground surface then heats up the surrounding air. When night falls, the exact opposite happens. The heated ground, plus the hot air, radiates the heat absorbed during the day back to the atmosphere, triggering rapid drop in temperatures. Temperatures at night can plummet to zero degrees Celsius..</p>

			<h2>Plants</h2>
			<p>When we talk about a desert biame sand plants and anmals it’s the feature of a desert. In spite of these challenges, a wide range of plants grows in this biome. The most common plants that are in desert biomes include Cactus, small shrubs, succulents, and grasses.

                To thrive in these harsh climatic conditions, desert plants have developed unique adaptations. Common adaptations include water storage in stems and leaves, shedding leaves, all to minimize water loss. Some have developed long taps roots to be able to reach water tables. Others become dormant until the rains return.
                
                The cactus plant, particularly, has adapted well to the harsh climatic conditions of desert biomes such that it’s able to grow up to 20 feet or more and liver for over 200 years. The Giant Saguaro cactus, in particular, has managed to thrive in this harsh biome due to shallow roots, which enables it to soak up rain and dew before it evaporates. Another adaptation of the cactus is that it grows slowly to save energy.
                
                The Mugma Tree is another plant adapted to live in desert biomes. It consists of small leaves that uniquely grow upwards and act as funnel when it rains. The funnel like leaves direct the rain water to the base of the tree, where it’s soaked up by shallow roots. Generally, this adaptation guarantees that the tree will get a lot of water when rain falls. Other plants of the desert biome include Brittle Bush, Desert Ironwood, Chainfruit Cholla, Joshua Tree, Palo Verde, Jumping Cholla, Ocotillo, Pancake Prickly Pear Cactus, Soaptree Yucca and Mojave Aster..</p>

			<h2>Animals</h2>
			<p>In case of the harsh climatic conditions in the desert biome, many animals live here. These animals have developed unique adaptations to help them keep cool and use less water. For example, a recognizable desert animal like the Camel can get by for days without food and water due to the fat stored in its hump. It also has thick fur and underwool to protect it from the coldest of winter. Its nostrils are able to be closed to keep out blowing sand.

                A camel has two rows of eyelashes to shield it eyes from the sun and blowing winds and broad hooves to prevent it from sinking in the sand. Foxes survive here due to their burrowing and nocturnal lifestyles. This burrowing ensures they escape the intense heat during the day. They also have large ears to help in the dissipation of excess body heat during hot days. Their thick, sandy fur helps protect them from the cold nights in the desert. The thick, sandy fur also helps reflect heat and for camouflage.
                
                Animals in desert biomes have also developed adaptations such as panting to minimize heat, seasonal migration. Other animals in the desert biome include Bobcats, Coyotes, Javelina, Desert Tortoise, Cactus Wren, Desert Kangaroo Rat, Sonoran Desert Toad, Thorny Devil.</p>

			<h2>Adaptations</h2>
			<p>Plants and animals in the desert biome have evolved unique adaptations to survive in this harsh environment. Some common adaptations include the ability to store water, the ability to burrow underground to escape the heat, and the ability to regulate body temperature to prevent overheating. The animals that make the desert their home must adapt not only to the lack of water but to the temperature that swing from very hot to very cold. Animals that survive these conditions do so in a variety of ways whether it's with large ears to radiate heat or thick coats to prevent sunburn and withstand freezing temperatures. Some are nocturnal, helping them avoid the heat of the day, and all of them make the most of very little water.</p>

        <h2>Abiotic Factors</h2>
        <p>Abiotic factors are the non-living things such as an area's soil, topography, and climate. The characteristics of a desert ecosystem are the lowest precipitation of all the other biomes and water scarcity. Temperatures touch higher and lower extremes due to the lack of humidity in the air.</p>

        <p>All living things require energy to survive. When one organism eats another organism, an energy transfer takes place. The consumer absorbs the energy and matter in the eaten organism's body. For example, a baby tortoise gains energy by consuming cacti, and a snake gains energy by eating a tortoise. This energy powers the consumer's metabolism, and the matter provides building blocks to construct and maintain the consumer's body. Ecologists use food chains to describe these energy paths in ecosystems.</p>
